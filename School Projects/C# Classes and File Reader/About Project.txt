The purpose of this project is to create a series of inherited classes within a class library. Using these related classes (the customer)
you are able to run the same method on the create object and it will run the appropriate calculation based on client type.

The objects are then stored on a txt file and read the next time the file loads.

Also equations are done to tally up totals for each customer time and overall statistics.
