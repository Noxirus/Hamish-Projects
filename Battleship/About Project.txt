The purpose of this project is to simulate the game battleship against the computer.
The computer will randomly select a series of places to put ships on a 10 x 10 grid. It will not overlap the ships nor will it allow them
to be placed out of bounds

It is then your task to input the X and Y coordinates to try and find the ships.
